Developing a Poker Game - Fight the Landlord (Dou Di Zhu)


Dou Di Zhu is a poker game for three players. One player, the "landlord", plays alone and the others form a team. The landlord's aim is to be the first to play out all his cards in valid combinations, and the team wins if any one of them manages to play all their cards before the landlord.
